features:
  - title: Everything on the GPU
    details: Points, heatmaps, hexagon and grid bins, arcs, trips and polygons, drawn with WebGPU. Binning, density, filters and playback run in shaders; moving a slider changes a few numbers on the GPU, not the data.
  - title: Our own basemap
    details: OpenStreetMap vector tiles, decoded in workers and drawn by smaltgl's own renderer in the same GPU pass as your data. Polygons fill through the stencil buffer; labels are laid out by the browser.
  - title: Columns in, pixels out
    details: Layers take typed arrays. A smaltdb query in columnar mode hands its numbers straight to the GPU; a smaltcy Cypher query becomes points and arcs.
  - title: Try it at any size
    details: The tech demo generates real-world-shaped data in your browser, from ten thousand rows to ten million, and shows what every step took on your machine.
